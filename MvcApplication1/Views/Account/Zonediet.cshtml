            The Zone Diet has been popular for several decades.

        </p>
        <p>
            It encourages followers to eat a certain amount of protein, carbs and fat at every meal in order to reduce inflammation in the body, among other health benefits.

        </p>
        <p>
            The Zone Diet instructs its followers to stick to eating a specific ratio of 40% carbs, 30% protein and 30% fat.

        </p>
        <p>
            As part of the diet, carbs should have a low glycemic index, which means they provide a slow release of sugar into the blood to keep you fuller for longer. Protein should be lean and fat should be mostly monounsaturated.

    <h1>
        How Do You Follow the Zone Diet?

    </h1>
    <p>
        The Zone Diet has no specific phases and is designed to be followed for a lifetime.

    </p>
    <p>
        There are two ways to follow the Zone Diet: the hand-eye method, or using Zone food blocks.

    </p>
    <p>
        Most people start with the hand-eye method and progress to using Zone food blocks later, since it is more advanced. You can switch between both methods whenever you feel like, since they each have their own benefits.

    </p>
    <h2>
        The Hand-Eye Method
    </h2>
    <p>
        The hand-eye method is the easiest way to start the Zone Diet.

    </p>
    <p>
        As the name suggests, your hand and eye are the only tools you need to get started, although wearing a watch is also recommended to keep an eye on when to eat.

    </p>
    <p>
        In this method, your hand takes on several uses. You use it to determine your portion sizes. Your five fingers remind you to eat five times a day and never go without food for five hours.

    </p>

    <p>
        Meanwhile, you use your eye to estimate portions on your plate. To design a Zone-friendly plate, you need to first divide your plate into thirds.

    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            One-third lean protein: One-third of your plate should have a source of lean protein, roughly the size and thickness of your palm.
        </li>
        <li>
            Two-thirds carbs: Two-thirds of your plate should be filled with carbs with a low glycemic index.
        </li>
        <li>
            A little fat: Add a dash of monounsaturated fat to your plate, such as olive oil, avocado or almonds.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The hand-eye method is designed to be a simple way for a beginner to follow the Zone Diet.

    </p>
    <p>
        It is also flexible and allows you to eat out at restaurants while on the Zone Diet, by using your hand and eyes as tools to choose options that fit Zone recommendations.

    </p>
    <h2>
        The Zone Food Block Method
    </h2>
    <p>
        Zone food blocks allow you to personalize the Zone Diet to your body by calculating how many grams of protein, carbs and fat you can have per day.

    </p>
    <p>
        The number of Zone blocks you should eat per day depends on your weight, height, waist and hip measurements.

    </p>
    <p>
        The average male eats 14 Zone blocks per day, while the average female eats 11 Zone blocks per day.

    </p>
    <p>
        A main meal such as breakfast, lunch or dinner contains three to five Zone blocks, while a snack always contains one Zone block.

    </p>
    <p>
        Each Zone block is made of a protein block, a fat block and a carb block.

    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Protein block: Contains 7 grams of protein.
        </li>
        <li>
            Carb block: Contains 9 grams of carbs.
        </li>
        <li>
            Fat block: Contains 1.5 grams of fat.
        </li>
    </ul>
